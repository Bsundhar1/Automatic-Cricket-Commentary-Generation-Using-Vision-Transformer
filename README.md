# 🏏 CRICOMM: Automatic Cricket Commentary Generation

This project is an **AI-powered cricket commentary system** that generates real-time match commentary from video input using **Vision Transformers (ViT), YOLO, GPT, and Streamlit**.  
It detects cricketing events (like Four, Six, Bowled) from video frames and produces **natural language commentary + audio output**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 **Event Detection**: Detects cricket shots (Four, Six, Bowled, etc.) using **YOLO + Vision Transformers**  
- 📝 **Commentary Generation**: Uses GPT-based text generation for natural commentary  
- 🔊 **Audio Output**: Converts generated text to speech for live-like experience  
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Supports precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation against ground truth  
- 🌐 **Interactive UI**: Built with **Streamlit** for easy video upload and live commentary display  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit  
- **Deep Learning**: Vision Transformer (ViT), YOLO, GPT  
- **NLP**: GPT-based text generation, duplicate filtering  
- **TTS**: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)  
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Model Training**: TensorFlow / PyTorch

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Automatic-Cricket-Commentary-Generation-Using-Vision-Transformer.git
   cd Automatic-Cricket-Commentary-Generation-Using-Vision-Transformer

2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. download datasets yourselves so that you can train a model yourself.


Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app/app.py


Upload a cricket video

The system extracts frames, detects events, and generates commentary

Commentary is displayed on screen and converted to speech
